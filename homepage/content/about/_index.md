## Hi there! I'm Jose.

I am a data engineer at Airbnb, currently on the Market Dynamics team to help our data science teams productionize metrics that measure Airbnb's competitiveness and maintain the health of our 200+ data pipelines. I was formerly on the Payments team at Airbnb, focused on Financial Infrastructure. I blur the divide between computer systems, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

I love writing code, solving problems, teaching math, and designing modules. Beyond my day job, I care a lot about computer science and math education, particularly for K-12 students. I have taught at Design Tech, Mission Bit, the Midtown Center for Boys, Stanford's CS106 series (introductory CS classes), and Stanford Splash. For fun, I love fixing and riding bikes. I also love playing foosball, billiards, and board games. I am a huge urban enthusiast and I am proud to have grown up in Chicago.

### More about me and my work.

#### [Resume // pdf](https://hernandezjose.github.io/resume.pdf)

At Airbnb, I work in tandem with our data scientists on the Market Dynamics team to build and optimize our data pipelines to be more reliable, efficient, and scalable.

When I was on the Financial Infrastructure team, I ensured that our accountants and stakeholders had high-quality, accurate data for reporting by improving our ETL pipelines and building tools to better monitor Airflow task health.

For my work, I use Scala, Hive, Spark, and Airflow.

Before joining Airbnb, I interned at Facebook as a software engineer -- first in Menlo Park and then in New York. While in Menlo Park, I redesigned and optimized the grammar query pipeline (graph search) on the Search NLP team. In New York, I added a multi-regional cache to a Messenger data service on the Messenger Infrastructure team. 

#### [Midtown Center for Boys // teacher](https://hernandezjose.github.io/midtown/)

This was a lot of work, but it was so much fun teaching! I taught four classrooms of 7th graders and three classrooms of 9th graders (15-20 students per classroom). Here are resources I created to help teach math to 7th and 9th graders. It also includes a list of enrichment programs, schools, and activities I recommend to my students. Let me know if you end up using this or parts of it for your curriculum!

#### [Stanford Infolab](http://infolab.stanford.edu/)

I had the opportunity to research on a team in the Stanford Infolab. The long-term goal of our project was to auto-generate study guides for MOOCs. We focused on developing a method for extracting keywords from video lectures, which would be used for a study guide. Check out [our research paper here](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1140/).

#### [Stanford Splash // teaching profile](https://stanfordesp.org/teach/teachers/josehdz/bio.html)

Here is my teaching profile for Stanford Splash (education for students by students). I have taught classes in game theory, [bike repair](https://stanfordesp.org/learn/Splash/2017_Spring/catalog#class_5838), [California housing history (Proposition 13)](https://stanfordesp.org/learn/Splash/2016_Spring/catalog#class_4998), and [origami](https://stanfordesp.org/learn/Splash/2016_Spring/catalog#class_5000) (learn how to fold a [Kawasaki rose](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/52/129646871_2ee97f8fb8_b.jpg) by following [this diagram](https://hernandezjose.github.io/kawasaki_rose_diagrams.pdf)). My favorite class to teach was [game theory](https://stanfordesp.org/learn/Splash/2017_Spring/catalog#class_5836)!

Elevating the mental grub in the world. I occasionally blog on a wide variety of topics that I care about, including math in the real world, what my journey looked like as I started coding, and STEM education.
