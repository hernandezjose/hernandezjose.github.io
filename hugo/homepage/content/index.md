I graduated from Stanford in 2017, and have been working at Airbnb ever since. For 2.5 years, I worked on the Financial Infrastructure team, where I helped build data pipelines to generate Airbnb's financial reports. I love diving into data and helping to streamline messy workflows.

Recently, I joined the Marked Dynamics team, where I focused on data quality for our pricing models. This will mean building pipeline monitoring tools, designing data validations, and more! I'll update this when my role is clearer :)

For fun, I love fixing and riding bikes. I love writing code, designing modules, solving problems, and teaching math.

## More about me and my work

### [Resume](/documents/resumes/resume_2016_11.pdf)

I've interned at Facebook twice — first in Menlo Park and last in New York. At MPK, I redesigned and optimized the grammar query pipeline (graph search) on the Search NLP team. Last summer, at NYC, I added a multi-regional cache to a Messenger data service on the Messenger Infrastructure team. If you'd like to get in touch, email me at josehdz at cs dot stanford dot edu.

### [Medium](https://medium.com/@josehdz)

Elevating the mental grub in the world.

### [Stanford InfoLab](http://infolab.stanford.edu/)

I had the opportunity to research on a team in the Stanford Infolab. The long-term goal is to auto-generate studyguides for MOOCs. We focused on developing a method for extracting keywords from video lectures, which would be used for a studyguide. Check out our [research paper](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1140/).

### Stanford Splash

Here is my teaching profile for Stanford Spash (education for students by students). I have taught classes in game theory, bike repair, California housing history (Proposition 13), and origami. My favorite has been game theory — I'm excited to iterate and improve it! Kawasaki rose by following this diagram. Looking forward to teach more classes next year.

### GitHub

I am the king of private repos, but this year many more projects will see the light of day. First, with faculty consent, I will be publishing my python script used to test my COOL compiler, written for Stanford's Compiler class last year. It fuzz tested the lexer, and auto-generated COOL code to test the parser and semantic-analyzer.
