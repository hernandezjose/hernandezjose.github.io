I graduated from Stanford in 2017, and have been working at Airbnb ever since. For 2.5 years, I worked on the Financial Infrastructure team, where I helped build data pipelines to generate Airbnb's financial reports. I love diving into data and helping to streamline messy workflows.

Recently, I joined the Marked Dynamics team, where I focused on data quality for our pricing models. This will mean building pipeline monitoring tools, designing data validations, and more! I'll update this when my role is clearer :)

For fun, I love fixing and riding bikes. I love writing code, designing modules, solving problems, and teaching math.
