### Recommended schools and activities

I went to Whitney Young Magnet High school from 7th-9th grade, and then I transferred to the Illinois Math and Science Academy for 10th-12th grade. I loved both, and I highly encourage all to apply. Remember that applying just gives you the option. You don't have to go, but don't deprive yourself of the option!

I also listed activities and competitions I did while I was in school. If you'd like more information about anything reach out!
